### Requirements

To install the necessary requirements in order to test this dumb game, just do a simple

```python3
python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

:exclamation: pygame works well with python 3.6.9, this is the version I had to use to be able to get the necessary dependecies when doing a pip install with python 3.6.9.
