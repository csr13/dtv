`python3.6`


Two required libraries included in `requirements.txt`

Some other dependencies might be required to use the full extension of pygame; depends on OS as well.

python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3.6 src/gameplay.py

#### Keys

* [up arrow]    - move up

I was going to write a bunch of lines u can toggle to change how the game acts, but then I realized you can actually toggle with everything :beer:

#### About icons, gifs, and sounds.

* Background image was taken from the pygame/data

* Unicorn was taken from Icon8

* Virus and heart were taken from animatedimages.org
